They have asked a data scientist to showcase this through a map. This data visualization will help in discussions on how to proceed with their research; they are dependent on how the map and clusters turn out. \nThe researcher's target audience are the university professors who have assigned them this research task. The researchers and university cares about this problem as this counts towards the final degree grade. Contrasting neighborhoods is the first step in the research process. "
